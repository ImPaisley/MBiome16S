# MBiome16S package

This repository houses all of the files included in the making of a package I created
to help conduct some common statistical and taxonomic microbiome analyses. The MBiome16S package
was created using a series of 16S V4 region analyses that are constantly conducted in the
Microbiology and Genetics lab at Nova Southeastern University. Some of these analyses
are also done during my master thesis on Lake Okeechobee (code found in LakeOMicrobiome repo 
in my proile).
